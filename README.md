# CS50x-2021 Introduction to computer science
 In this repository you will find my progress in the [CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). <br />
 
 Try to solve the problems by your own, is the only way to learn. Do not just copy a code without understanding it.<br />
 Take a view to the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/) of the course.

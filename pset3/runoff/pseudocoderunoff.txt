        save the candidate of preferences[i][j]

IS TIE (int min)

for i = 0 until < candidates
    if candidate is not eliminated
        add one to number of candidates still runing
    if candidate amount of votes is equal to min
        add one to number of candidates with the min amount of votes
if both numbers are equal
